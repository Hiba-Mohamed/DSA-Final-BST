# Demo Spring Boot Application

This is a simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates the use of a Binary Search Tree (BST) implemented in Java. The application allows for inserting values into the BST, traversing it, and visualizing the tree structure in JSON format.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
2. Install dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using Maven:
```
```bash
cd <project-directory>
mvn install
```
3. Run the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Spring Boot application:

Run the DemoApplication.java file directly from your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
4. Access the application
Once the application is running, open your web browser and visit:

http://localhost:8080/
This will open the application in your browser. You can interact with the app and explore the Binary Search Tree functionality.
